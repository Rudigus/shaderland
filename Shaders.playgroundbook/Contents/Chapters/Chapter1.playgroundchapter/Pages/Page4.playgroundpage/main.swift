 # Conclusion
 
 Hey, Rodrigo here, I'm back! I hope you have enjoyed this playground and learned a bit about shaders and their magnificence :P
 
 Our brief shader journey has come to an end, but there are still many things you can explore! You can try searching for shaders online, I'm sure you'll find many crazy, interesting and mind-boggling shaders out there. What was presented here is really the tip of the iceberg.
 
 By the way, this playground has a Bonus chapter! Consider checking it if you have time :)
 
 The first page of the Bonus chapter is [About Me](Chapter2.playgroundchapter/About%20Me), where you'll find some personal information about myself :D
 
 The second page of the Bonus chapter is [Sandbox](Chapter2.playgroundchapter/Sandbox). If a playground is a place to learn by going through what others have prepared for you, then a sandbox is a place to learn by experimenting yourself. Don't forget the fun too!
 
 That's all, thank you for your time and see you in the next WWDC!
