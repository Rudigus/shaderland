# A Brief Journey in Shaders

Hello, welcome to *A Brief Journey in Shaders*! I'm Rodrigo and we'll be learning what shaders are and a bit of what they can do. For me, they are fascinating things which keeps me dumbfoundedly staring at my screen. They're like magic right at your device! I hope you enjoy it :)
 
 ## The Basics
 
 What are shaders, really? They are little programs that modify how things are drawn to a screen. Special effects? Check. Animations? Check. You can:
 - Light up environments
 - Deform spatial and plane figures
 - Make smooth and realistic animations
 - Color objects in an advanced manner
 
 and many more, it just depends on your imagination!
 
 Now, let's talk a bit about how do shaders work. Today, the main way to draw something to the screen is through the rendering pipeline, which is a sequence of steps taken to achieve that. Some of those steps are already prepared for the drawing process, while others are deliberately left for us to provide. The ones we can provide are what we call shaders.
 
 Knowing this, shaders can be classified based on the order in which they appear on the rendering pipeline. Here, we will look at two types of shaders, Vertex Shaders and Fragment Shaders. These two types can be considered the most important, since they are mandatory: you can't start the drawing process without providing them.
 
 Let's start by discussing the Vertex Shader in the [next page](@next).
