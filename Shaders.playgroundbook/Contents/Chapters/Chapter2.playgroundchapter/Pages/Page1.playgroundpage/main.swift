 # About Me

 Hello, my name is Rodrigo Matos Aguiar. I currently participate in the Apple Developer Academy program and I'm majoring in Computer Engineering at Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Ceará (IFCE).
 
 Besides programming, I like playing games (mostly online), watching anime and spending time with my family. For me, the world is a really amazing place, despite its many problems, and I am constantly surprised by what others come up with. To be honest, I'm not very used to speaking about myself and I find those kinds of introductions somewhat robotic, but let's follow the procedure I guess :P
 
 Why shaders? I am really interested in game development, and shaders are really popular there, probably because of the creativity aspect and the ease of sharing them (just make a GIF). Therefore, I have tried searching about them in the past, but I lost interest pretty quickly: many people warned about how difficult it was to write shaders, and that you probably should stay away from it if you could.
 
 Recently, I had free time to try out new things so I decided to pick shaders. After some time learning about them, I can agree with the general opinion: shaders are indeed hard. Still, that doesn't mean you shouldn't learn it, it just means you should take your time. If I had to give one advice, I would say: keep experimenting. It's easy to get demotivated if you just keep learning the theory (there's a lot of it), so don't forget to practice. Thankfully, there are some sites where you can write shaders without much hassle, I recommend giving them a go.
 
 I think that's it, this playground was a fun ride, albeit a bit tiresome one, and I hope I could be of help.
